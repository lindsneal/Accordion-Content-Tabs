        <p>softBusiness Enterprise™ makes a distinction between operational accounting and financial accounting. Operational accounting involves capturing all transactions involving the business in their natural form as soon as they occur. Financial and tax accounting decisions about the transactions can be made later, so data collection can be initially performed by electronic data capture or human data entry without having to understand the ultimate accounting disposition of the transactions. Higher priced accounting professionals do not need to be used to enter the bulk of the basic transactional data of the business.</p>

        </div>

        <p>In addition, other non-financial information can also be recorded and appropriately stored along with the financial information at the point the information enters the company. For example, softTechnology Manager™ also enables the capture of other important information about computer hardware and software purchases that would not normally be captured by an accounting system at the same time the financial aspects of the transaction are being captured.</p>

        <p>Company managers immediately have complete access to all the information associated with running their business so that real time operational decisions can be made without waiting to see the financial accounting results.</p>

        <p>softBusiness Enterprise™ also works seamlessly with the applications of the softInformation Enterprise™ data layer.</p>

              <p>SoftScience Group, Inc. (SSG), a software engineering firm specializing in petroleum industry applications, has developed softPetroleum Enterprise™, the first enterprise-wide software environment for oil and gas company information management. softPetroleum Enterprise™ is commercially available from Petroleum Science Corporation.</p>

              <p>Our software environment includes an integrated information architecture (the softPetroleum Enterprise™ data layer) that underlies user interface and tool layers (views). Each suite of user views (i.e. each software product) corresponds to one or more of the various technical, operational, and financial roles within an oil and gas producing enterprise. Each of these integrated products is designed to allow an individual to perform the complete range of tasks associated with that role using the data layer's enterprise-wide knowledge.</p>

              <p>The software applications for performing these different tasks are built on top of the common enterprise data foundation. Interfaces for different tasks can "see" appropriate subsets of the common integrated corporate data. These interface and functionality groupings make up PSC's application software products including softPetroleum Appraiser™, softPetroleum Operator™, softPetroleum Data Scout™, and softProperty Tax Manager™.</p>

              
              <p>softPetroleum Appraiser™  is a subset of an enterprise-wide information system that provides the tools for an evaluator to determine the value of petroleum properties. It is connected to corporate data through the softPetroleum Enterprise™ data layer and therefore has a direct and powerful set of tools to project future production and the future financial performance (cash flows) which are likely to result from the operation of particular petroleum properties. Those expected financial results, i.e. the future value of the properties, can then be used for a variety of purposes.</p>

              
              <p>softPetroleum Appraiser™  can be used to value reserves for corporate financial statements, to value assets subject to acquisition, sales, or financing, and to provide valuations for property tax appraisal. The system can also be used for conventional reservoir engineering studies, for reserve management, and by production engineers for evaluating the economic merits of well re-completions or other well improvements.  Virtually any type of analysis of the performance of a petroleum property from a reserve and financial standpoint can be performed using the tools within softPetroleum Appraiser™.</p>

              <p>softPropertyTax Manager™ (sPTM) is an enterprise-wide information system for conducting and managing tax compliance and payment activities for ad valorem (property tax) and excise (sales and use tax) taxes.</p>
              <p>Within sPTM's property tax management system, all classes of property can be appropriately handled. Property classes include real estate, personal property, producing and non-producing mineral leaseholds (including both operated and non-operated interests), and other categories of cross-jurisdictional property such as pipelines and rolling stock.</p>
              <p>The system is designed to manage the entire property tax compliance function from renditions, to valuations, through tax bill processing (tax verification) and payment of taxes. Comprehensive tools are provided so taxes can be allocated back to the appropriate properties for accounting functions like joint interest billing.</p>
              
              
              <p>Jurisdictional information including tax rates, tax calendar, collecting responsibilities, etc. for assessing, taxing, and collecting jurisdictions is maintained within the system.Â  Asset locations are also linked to each taxing jurisdiction that levies tax on property located within its geographic boundaries.Â  Check/payment requests can be automatically generated for a tax collecting jurisdiction based on the property values entered/loaded into the system.Â  Also, softProperty Tax Manager™Â  is closely integrated with softPetroleum Appraiser™ (sPA)Â  and can automatically extract oil and gas property valuation data from sPA.Â  The valuation of other classes of property can be performed directly within softProperty Tax Manager™.</p>
